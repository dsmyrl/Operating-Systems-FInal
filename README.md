# Operating-Systems-Final
This repository is for a final project that is a game menu with four games in it. The first game is pong, the second game is guessing the number, the third game is war, and the fourth game is made by my partner on this project zja2001.


The first class in the code itself is a menu selection for the 4 individual games. once you click on one of them you will be brought to the specified game.

The first game that we have is a GUI-based game of pong 

The way that the program works is that is made up of 7 different stacks that pass several cards based on how it progresses \n Stacks:

The initial main deck of 52 cards

player deck

computer deck

player discard pile

computer discard pile

the player war Set Up

computer war setup

The program then compares the value of the cards to determine the winner and the winner of the round keeps his card and the computer player's card and puts them into the respective discard pile until the need to shuffle the discard pile into the respective main deck.


the third game that we created was a text-based dungeon crawler game 

it uses two characters of different classes. One is a warrior class while the other is a mage class with a manna system implemented. 

it uses priority queues that implement a speed stat to the game that determines who goes first during each of the battles. you are also able to take your surroundings to pick a path of where to go next and at the end if you want to circle back to previously visited rooms pick items you may not have been able to get on the first visit

the third and final game is a simple number-guessing game that has a random number between one and ten. that the user has to see if they can guess within three tries. if the user gets it wrong the first time then the program will tell the user if they were too high or too low. if they are not able to then the program will ask if they want to try again with a new number.
